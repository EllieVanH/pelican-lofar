Build Instructions
------------------

Dependencies
------------
  cmake
  qt4 (>4.2)
  pelican
  cuda toolkit (optional)
  boost (signals, smart pointers, and program options)

Before compiling the code
-------------------------
Make sure that you have specified environment variable $PELICAN_INSTALL_DIR in .mysetenv.bash

PELICAN_INSTALL_DIR=/Code/ampp/pelican/build/install; export PELICAN_INSTALL_DIR

Setup A Build Directory
-----------------------
For src code at /Code/ampp/pelican-lofar

mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=release ../src  -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS="-O3 -parallel -openmp -xSSE4.2 -fPIC" -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=/opt/intel/bin/icpc -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=/opt/intel/bin/icc -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/Code/ampp/pelican-lofar/build/install

In case of an error you may need to specify where the various dependencies are.
This can be done with more -D options to cmake. See the documentation at the top
of the relevant FindXXX.cmake files in the
/Code/ampp/pelican-lofar/src/cmake directory to find the correct variables to set.

If all has gone well CMake will of created you build directory and makefiles.
To build the project you should now type your systems make command

make

if everything compiles then install files by typing

make install

After compilation
-----------------

Add the following line to your .mysetenv.bash file

PATH=$PATH:/Code/ampp/pelican-lofar/build/install/pelican-lofar/bin; export PATH

to add pelican-lofar binaries to the PATH

General remarks
---------------

Due to the compatibility issues between DAL 2.5.0 library and pelican-lofar code
the HDF5 data pipeline building has been disabled and will not be functional. If
you have expertise to correct this you are welcome to fiddle around.
